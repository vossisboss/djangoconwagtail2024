# Step Four: Creating a basic blog

Now that you've extended the Home page and added some custom models that we'll need, let's add the key parts of our blog. To do that, you'll need to create a new app with the command:

```
python manage.py startapp blog
```

Then you need to add that app to `INSTALLED_APPS` in `myblog/settings/base.py`:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "blog",
    "home",
    "search",
    "custom_media",
    "wagtail.contrib.forms",
    "wagtail.contrib.redirects",
    # ...
]
```

## :memo: A quick note on project structure :memo:
In Wagtail projects, it is generally a good idea to keep related models in separate apps because it makes it a little easier for you to manage changes that affect migrations. Also, it makes it a little easier to decide where to put new code or models. Some Wagtail developers like to use a "core" or "base" app for models that are used across their projects. Others prefer not to use that approach because it can make future migrations a little trickier to manage. Both approaches are valid! For this tutorial though, we're going to use the separate app approach.

Now that you have a blog app added to your project, navigate to `blog/models.py`. We're going to create two new page types for our blog. Wagtail is a CMS that uses a tree structure to organize content. There are parent pages and child pages. The ultimate parent page by default is the Home page. All other page types branch off of the Home page. Then child pages can branch off of those pages too.

First, you need to create a parent type for the blog. Most Wagtail developers will call these pages "index" pages, so this one will be called `BlogPageIndex`. Add the following code to your `models.py` file in the blog app:

```

from wagtail.models import Page
from wagtail.fields import RichTextField
from wagtail.admin.panels import FieldPanel


class BlogIndexPage(Page):
    intro = RichTextField(blank=True)

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('intro')
    ]

    subpage_types = ['blog.BlogPage']
```

This is a very simple version of `BlogIndexPage` with only a single `intro` field to describe the blog. You'll be adding a few more things to it later, but this will work right now for getting your blog set up. We're also adding a setting called `subpage_type` that will link `BlogIndexPage` to a specific child page type. It's unlikely that blog editors will be creating any other page types connected to `BlogIndexPage`, so adding this setting improves their user experience by reducing the number of clicks they have to make to set up a page.

Next, we need to create a child page called `BlogPage`. Think about the fields you need for a reader to enjoy a blog post. The title is included by default, so what else do you need? Blogs can get pretty messy without dates to organize them, so you'll need a `date` frield for sure. Let's type:

```
class BlogPage(Page):
    date = models.DateField("Post date")

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('date'),
    ]

```

Let's add an `intro` field to this page type too so that you can use it to give readers a preview of the blog post.

```
class BlogPage(Page):
    date = models.DateField("Post date")
    intro = models.CharField(max_length=250)

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('date'),
        FieldPanel('intro'),
    ]
```

Note that `intro` has `max_length` added to it. This provides a character limit on the field so that writers won't get too long-winded and break your website's design with descriptions that are too long. You're welcome to give them more characters to work with if you want to.

You'll also need a `body` field to provide a place to put your post content (since creating a blog without a place to put content kind of defeats the purpose of a blog). We're also going to add the `parent_page_type` setting to link `BlogPage` to `BlogIndexPage`.

```
class BlogPage(Page):
    date = models.DateField("Post date")
    intro = models.CharField(max_length=250)
    body = RichTextField(blank=True)

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('date'),
        FieldPanel('intro'),
        FieldPanel('body'),
    ]

    parent_page_types = ['blog.BlogIndexPage']
```

## Making your blog searchable

Now, those fields are a good start for a basic blog. While we're here though, let's take a moment to make the content of your blog searchable. Update `models.py` with this code:

```
class BlogPage(Page):
    date = models.DateField("Post date")
    intro = models.CharField(max_length=250)
    body = RichTextField(blank=True)

    search_fields = Page.search_fields + [
        index.SearchField('intro'),
        index.SearchField('body'),
    ]

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('date'),
        FieldPanel('intro'),
        FieldPanel('body'),
    ]

    parent_page_types = ['blog.BlogIndexPage']
```

Then add `from wagtail.search import index` to your import statements so that the whole file looks like this:

```
from django.db import models

from wagtail.models import Page
from wagtail.fields import RichTextField
from wagtail.admin.panels import FieldPanel
from wagtail.search import index


class BlogIndexPage(Page):
    intro = RichTextField(blank=True)

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('intro')
    ]

class BlogPage(Page):
    date = models.DateField("Post date")
    intro = models.CharField(max_length=250)
    body = RichTextField(blank=True)

    search_fields = Page.search_fields + [
        index.SearchField('intro'),
        index.SearchField('body'),
    ]

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('date'),
        FieldPanel('intro'),
        FieldPanel('body'),
    ]

    parent_page_types = ['blog.BlogIndexPage']
```

Save all of your work. Then run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to check that the fields have been added to the Wagtail admin.

## Adding Wagtail StreamField

One of the best parts of Wagtail is [StreamField](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/topics/streamfield.html). StreamField gives users the power to mix and match different "blocks" of content rather than having a strict structure for a page. For example, someone writing a blog post could add a "quote" block to highlight a particular quote or phrase from their post. Or they could add a "sidebar" block that includes a little extra bonus content on the page. There aren't many limits to the types of blocks you can create.

To show you StreamField in action, you're going to create a simple StreamField implementation in the blog post `body` using some of the [default blocks](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/streamfield/blocks.html?highlight=blocks) that come with Wagtail. First, update your import statements in your `models.py` file so they look like this:

```
from wagtail.models import Page
from wagtail.fields import RichTextField, StreamField
from wagtail.admin.panels import FieldPanel
from wagtail.search import index
from wagtail.embeds.blocks import EmbedBlock
from wagtail import blocks
from wagtail.images.blocks import ImageChooserBlock
```


Next, replace the `body` definition from `RichTextField` in your `BlogPage` class with the following code:

```
    body = StreamField([
        ('heading', blocks.CharBlock(form_classname="title")),
        ('paragraph', blocks.RichTextBlock()),
        ('image', ImageChooserBlock()),
        ('embed', EmbedBlock(max_width=800, max_height=400)),
    ])
```

Your whole file should now look like this:

```
from django.db import models

from wagtail.models import Page
from wagtail.fields import RichTextField, StreamField
from wagtail.admin.panels import FieldPanel
from wagtail.search import index
from wagtail.embeds.blocks import EmbedBlock
from wagtail import blocks
from wagtail.images.blocks import ImageChooserBlock


class BlogIndexPage(Page):
    intro = RichTextField(blank=True)

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('intro')
    ]

    subpage_types = ['blog.BlogPage']

class BlogPage(Page):
    date = models.DateField("Post date")
    intro = models.CharField(max_length=250)
    body = StreamField([
        ('heading', blocks.CharBlock(form_classname="title")),
        ('paragraph', blocks.RichTextBlock()),
        ('image', ImageChooserBlock()),
        ('embed', EmbedBlock(max_width=800, max_height=400)),
    ])

    search_fields = Page.search_fields + [
        index.SearchField('intro'),
        index.SearchField('body'),
    ]

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + [
        FieldPanel('date'),
        FieldPanel('intro'),
        FieldPanel('body'),
    ]

    parent_page_types = ['blog.BlogIndexPage']
```

Save your file and then run the migration commands `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`. Start up the development server real quick with `python manage.py runserver` then have a look at a blank Blog Page. You'll notice that the "body" section now has a green plus sign in it. When you click on it, a collection of blocks will appear for you to choose from. You can experiment with combining blocks if you want to.

TODO:

- Add section where we load initial content via fixture to ensure people see the accessibility issues we want to demonstrate.
  - Add note to earlier sections to make sure people don't change any of the names in the same code, or the fixture won't work.
- Add "Adding templates for your blog pages" section from previous tutorial's Step 4
  - Make a couple intentional accessibility errors along the lines of what Scott fixes in the Bakery Demo during his DjangoCon talk (but don't call attention to them in this README)
- Add some basic styling to myblog.css that attendees can paste in
- End this step by viewing the frontend with our imported content
